Recession Data analysis using the Layoffs Data 2022 Dataset
Introduction:
This document analyzes the layoffs in various organizations using a dataset
obtained from Kaggle
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theakhilb/layoffs-data-2022?resource=down
load). The analysis includes data preprocessing, aggregation, visualization,
and identifying companies that have benefitted from layoffs.
Data Preprocessing:
a. Import numpy and pandas libraries.
b. Load the dataset (layoffs_data.csv) into a DataFrame.
1. c. Remove unnecessary columns, fill in missing values, and convert the
'Date' column to a datetime object.
Data Aggregation:
2. a. Aggregate the laid off count by industry, location, and country.
Data Visualization:
3. a. Create pie charts to show the number of people laid off in each
industry, location, and country.
Top Five Countries Analysis:
a. Focus on the top five countries with the most layoffs.
b. Calculate the total number of employees in each organization.
4. c. Group the data by industry to find the total employee count and laid
off count for every industry.
Industry-wise Layoff Percentage:
a. Calculate the layoff percentage for each industry in the USA, India,
Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Brazil.
5. b. Visualize the results in bar graphs.
Headquarters Location Analysis:
a. Analyze the data based on the location headquarters for companies
belonging to the worstly affected countries.
b. Calculate the employee and layoff count (headquarter location-wise) for
each country.
6. c. Create line graphs depicting the headquarter location-wise layoff
percentage.
Identifying Companies Benefitting from Layoffs:
a. Create a 'Benefit' column in the dataset.
b. Calculate the average benefit for each company.
c. Sort the companies by average benefit in descending order.
d. Plot a bar graph of the top five most profitable companies.
7. e. Create a heatmap to visualize the benefit of Netflix across different
days and headquarter locations.
Conclusion:
The analysis provides insights into the impact of layoffs across different
industries and countries, as well as the effect of headquarters' location on
layoffs. Furthermore, it identifies companies that have benefitted from layoffs,
with Netflix being the most notable example. It is important to note that
correlation does not imply causation, and other factors may contribute to the
observed differences in layoff percentages.

This code is designed to analyze data related to company layoffs. The main goal is to
preprocess the data, explore relationships between features using visualizations, and build
machine learning models to predict the country of a company's headquarters based on the
given features.
Step by step explanation:
1. Import necessary libraries: numpy for linear algebra and pandas for data processing.
2. Read the CSV file containing layoffs data into a pandas DataFrame called data.
3. Display the DataFrame data.
4. Drop the unnecessary columns (Source, List_of_Employees_Laid_Off, Date_Added)
from the DataFrame.
5. Check for missing values in the DataFrame.
6. Fill the missing values with 0 and store the result in a new DataFrame df.
7. Check if there are any missing values remaining in df.
8. Display the info and summary statistics of the df DataFrame.
9. Group the DataFrame by different categorical variables (Country, Company,
Location_HQ, Industry) and compute the mean of numerical variables for each
group.
10. Import the seaborn library for data visualization and create a heatmap to show the
correlation between variables.
11. Create pair plots to visualize the relationships between variables, colored by Industry,
Stage, and Country, respectively.
12. Create a distribution plot of the Laid_Off_Count variable, colored by the Stage
variable.
13. Determine the number of unique values in the DataFrame.
14. Separate the numerical and categorical columns in the DataFrame.
15. Drop the 'Date' and 'Company' columns from the DataFrame, and store the result in
df_new.
16. Encode the categorical variables (Stage, Country, Industry, Location_HQ) as integer
values.
17. Define the features (X) and the target variable (y, the country of a company's
headquarters).
18. Import necessary libraries for machine learning and split the data into training and
testing sets.
19. Train a DecisionTreeClassifier, BaggingClassifier, and RandomForestClassifier on
the training data, and make predictions on the testing data.
20. Evaluate the accuracy of each model on the testing data.
21. For the DecisionTreeClassifier, visualize the decision tree.
22. Print the accuracy scores for all three models.
In summary, this code preprocesses the layoffs data, explores relationships between
features using visualizations, and builds machine learning models to predict the country of a
company's headquarters based on the given features. The accuracy scores of the models
are printed at the end to assess their performance.
Predicting the country of a company's headquarters based on the given features can be
useful in various scenarios. For instance, it could be used to:
1. Identify potential markets: By understanding the factors that influence where
companies establish their headquarters, businesses can identify potential markets for
expansion or investment. This can help them make more informed decisions about
which countries to target for growth.
2. Market segmentation: Companies may want to segment their customer base based
on location for targeted marketing efforts or product localization. Predicting the
country of headquarters can help organizations better understand the regional
distribution of their customers or potential partners.
3. Regulatory compliance: Different countries have different regulations and compliance
requirements for businesses. By predicting the country of a company's headquarters,
organizations can proactively identify potential regulatory issues and plan
accordingly.
4. Risk management: Companies may face different levels of risk depending on the
country in which they are headquartered. Predicting the country of headquarters can
help businesses better understand the risk profile of their partners or competitors.
5. Economic analysis: Researchers or analysts may use this information to understand
the distribution of industries or business activities across different countries. This can
help them gain insights into macroeconomic trends, regional development, or the
impact of policies on business growth.
Sample example:
Consider an e-commerce platform that wants to identify potential markets for expansion.
They have collected data on various companies that operate in the e-commerce space,
including the number of employees laid off, the industry, the company's stage of
development, and other relevant information. By building a machine learning model to
predict the country of a company's headquarters based on these features, the e-commerce
platform can identify countries where similar businesses are already thriving. This
information can then be used to guide their expansion strategy and help them choose which
countries to focus on for growth.
Certainly, let me provide a more concrete example with hypothetical company names.
Imagine an e-commerce platform called "ShopGlobal" that wants to expand its operations to
new markets. They decide to analyze the market landscape by looking into other companies
in the e-commerce space.
ShopGlobal collects data on various companies, including:
● Company A: An online fashion retailer headquartered in the United States
● Company B: A grocery delivery service based in the United Kingdom
● Company C: A consumer electronics e-commerce company based in Germany
● Company D: An online marketplace for handmade products located in India
The collected data includes features like the number of employees laid off, the industry (e.g.,
fashion, grocery, electronics), the company's stage of development (e.g., startup, growth,
mature), and other relevant information.
ShopGlobal wants to identify potential markets for expansion by predicting the country of a
company's headquarters based on these features. They build a machine learning model
using the data they've collected.
After training the model, they use it to predict the headquarters location of a new
e-commerce company, Company E, which specializes in selling eco-friendly products. Based
on the features of Company E, the model predicts that it is likely to be headquartered in the
United States.
Based on this prediction, ShopGlobal could infer that there might be a strong market for
e-commerce companies in the United States, making it a suitable target for their expansion.
Additionally, they can analyze the model's predictions for other companies to determine
which countries have a higher concentration of e-commerce businesses, helping them
prioritize their expansion efforts.
In this example, predicting the country of a company's headquarters allows ShopGlobal to
make more informed decisions about which countries to target for growth by understanding
the regional distribution of e-commerce companies
